Here is a first PoC for having OpenSUSE MicroOS on WSL2.

The Windows 10 version is the Insiders Dev channel build 21364.

In a nutshell, the setup and tools used are as follow:

1. MicroOS rootfs extract from p.lxroot.img (qcow2 disk image)

2. MicroOS vhdx mounted into WSL2

3. WSL2 SystemD script from Daniel Llewellyn (https://github.com/diddledan/one-script-wsl2-systemd/tree/build-21286+)

4. WSLG for the Wayland graphics and Pulseaudio capabilities

5. podman for running the containers, in this case Firefox from Jessie Frazelle


All that, stitched together by the crazy Corsair.

Hope you enjoy.

reply from nunixtech:
For the rootfs, the short answer is: no, ext4 only for the time being.
Long answer, and base of my next blog: you can use the WSL base "layer" as a boot partition, and with a script jump into a chroot and use another disk formatted with BTRFS.

I really like your questions, because it's exactly what I was testing and came with a workaround with my colleague (and maintainer of MicroOS)
