Unlike Debian and thus .deb-based CBL-Delridge, CBL-Mariner is .rpm-based, with .spec files borrowed from VMware's Photon OS, openmamba, and the Fedora Project. The project also acknowledges Linux from Scratch, so despite being .rpm-based, CBL-Mariner is not a derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or SUSE Linux. It is something new.
